                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>In this project, I conceived, developed, and implemented an advanced predictive maintenance program targeting various HVAC motors. The program harnesses live data, motor design specifications, and predictive modeling techniques to proactively detect equipment degradation and suboptimal performance. The primary objective is to mitigate costly and unforeseen equipment failures within HVAC systems.</p>
                </div>

                  <h4>Methods and Tools</h4>
                  <p>In this portfolio, I showcase my proficiency in developing a state-of-the-art predictive maintenance program. Here's a brief breakdown of the key methods and tools used:</p>
                  <ol>
                      <li>Real-Time Monitoring: Implementing real-time monitoring allows for the continuous collection of crucial HVAC motor performance metrics. This live data stream serves as the foundation for early anomaly detection and proactive decision-making.</li>
                      <li>Historical Data Analysis: Through in-depth historical data analysis, I uncover valuable insights, identifying trends and anomalies in past motor behavior. This historical context is pivotal for understanding equipment evolution.</li>
                      <li>Data Preprocessing: My data preprocessing skills ensure the reliability and quality of the dataset. By cleaning, transforming, and enhancing the data, I guarantee its suitability for predictive modeling by eliminating stagnant, and out of range data. </li>
                      <li>Predictive Modeling: I leverage advanced predictive modeling techniques to forecast equipment performance. My models, trained on historical data trends and design specifications, are pivotal  in detecting anomalies and predicting potential failures.</li>
                      <li>Feature Engineering: My proficiency in feature engineering enhances predictive accuracy by creating pertinent features from the dataset. This process enriches the data, allowing models to capture nuanced patterns effectively.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>This portfolio highlights my contribution to optimizing maintenance strategies, reducing downtime, and enhancing equipment longevity through the application of these critical methods and tools. </p>

                        <p>After the model was built, 8 pieces of equipment were selected for vibration testing to verify the results of the program. The model predicted the failing equipment with an 87% accuracy rate (7 of 8). Seven of units were found to have severe bearing fatigue or motor failure and were scheduled for replacement or repairs. </p>
                        <p>Here is a sample of the graphic that was used to identify the degrading equipment. We are able to filter by the equipment, Motor HZ, and timestamp in order to visualize the score over time, as well as the score for each bin Motor HZ. We generally noticed the score would decrease in the upper motor speeds first and slowly transition to all motor speeds.</p>

                        <li class="col-md-12">Integration of Design Data: We integrated design data into the system to perform back calculations.

                                    Score Calculation: Using both predicted and actual KW values, we calculated a score on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. This score served as an indicator of equipment health and performance.

                <li>
                    Integrating a lifetime data pool that will allow us to begin estimating the lifetime of use based on the predictive maintenance score. Added integration with vibrations testing should serve to further the utility and accuracy of this tool as a Predictive and Preventative platform but will need to be validated over time through pilot projects.

                    <p>Selecting a vehicle involved a combination of budgeting, must-haves, and personal desires to arrive at a reasonable choice. With numerous options available, each presenting its own pros and cons, determining the "best" one proved challenging.</p>
                    <p>A significant portion of the engineering process coincided with creating the vehicle/camper decision matrix, as much of the build aimed to stay within budget constraints. This involved determining the required power for a solar system, wiring configurations, insulation methods, and wall attachment techniques. While many resources are now available online, this occurred during the early stages of the "van life" movement when less detailed tutorials were around.</p>

                    <p><span class = "light_bold-text">The construction process was relatively straightforward but required some strategic planning, as certain elements such as wiring and the bed dimensions influenced the size of other components in the van.</span> The sequence of tasks unfolded as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Removed the existing walls, then cut a hole in the roof for the fan and ran wires throughout the van for outlets before reinstalling the walls.</li>
                      <li>Built and installed the bed frame, along with the flip-down seat integrated into the bed structure.</li>
                      <li>Constructed and installed the kitchen.</li>
                      <li>Completed the wiring for lights and outlets in the van.</li>
                      <li>Installed racks to accommodate skis, climbing gear, and bikes in the gear garage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After determining suitable dimensions for the bed and kitchen counter, I commenced cutting wood. Undertaking this project in Seattle, particularly without a garage during the shoulder season, posed challenges. Daily tasks involved hauling tools and wood from the basement, significantly prolonging the project timeline.</p>
                    <p>Although I possessed some woodworking experience, it was primarily in a well-equipped shop. Consequently, I enjoyed employing creative techniques to measure and execute long straight cuts using only a jigsaw, circular saw, 2x4, and clamps.</p>

                    <p><span class = "light_bold-text">Importance of Goal Adherence:</span> Recognized the significance of staying true to initial project objectives despite evolving visions and external influences.</p>
                    <p><span class = "light_bold-text">Value of Continuous Improvement:</span> Found satisfaction in continually refining and enhancing the project while ensuring completion criteria were met.</p>
                    <p><span class = "light_bold-text">Acknowledgment of Oversight:</span> Although the van initially met desired criteria, the oversight of not prioritizing 4WD for easy mountain access during winter became apparent. This led to the realization of the need for a vehicle with 4WD capabilities.</p>
                    <p><span class = "light_bold-text">Preparation for Delays:</span> Acknowledged the inevitability of delays in projects of this nature and emphasized the importance of building in extra time during construction to mitigate stress levels.</p>
                    <p><span class = "light_bold-text">Tailoring Solutions to Personal Needs:</span> Discovered that personal requirements may differ significantly from recommendations found online. For instance, the electrical system was oversized, resulting in unnecessary expenses. Adjusting the system based on my actual needs rather than theoretical needs could have saved substantial costs upfront, highlighting the importance of evaluating personal requirements before making decisions.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>For example: With 200W of solar and a 200aH battery, my battery level ever dropped below 80%. That was with running a laptop, small hot water pot, lights, and camera gear for days on end. Solar panels are cheap, but batteries are about 1.2-1.5$/aH and if I had picked a 100aH battery that would have saved about $1000 right out the gate.</li>

                <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>In this project, I conceived, developed, and implemented an advanced predictive maintenance program targeting various HVAC motors. The program harnesses live data, motor design specifications, and predictive modeling techniques to proactively detect equipment degradation and suboptimal performance. The primary objective is to mitigate costly and unforeseen equipment failures within HVAC systems.</p>
